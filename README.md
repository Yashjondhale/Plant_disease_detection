# plant_disease_detection
🌿 Welcome to the Plant Disease Detection System! Upload an image of a plant leaf, and let our AI detect potential diseases. 🌿  
This system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to identify plant diseases based on leaf images. By detecting diseases early, farmers can take preventive measures to ensure healthy crop growth and sustainable agriculture.

Features:
Accurate plant disease prediction.
Support for a wide range of plant species and diseases.
IoT integration for real-time environment data.
